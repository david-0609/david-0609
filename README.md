# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub.  ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

You can now find me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/david-0609) instead.

Any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.

Join us; you can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too!
